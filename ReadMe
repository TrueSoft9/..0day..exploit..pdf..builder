The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) recently uncovered a DarkGate campaign in mid-January 2024, which exploited CVE-2024-21412 through the use of fake software installers. 
During this campaign, users were lured using PDFs that contained Google DoubleClick Digital Marketing (DDM) open redirects that led unsuspecting victims to compromised sites 
hosting the Microsoft Windows SmartScreen bypass CVE-2024-21412 that led to malicious Microsoft (.MSI) installers. The phishing campaign employed open redirect URLs from 
Google Ad technologies to distribute fake Microsoft software installers (.MSI) masquerading as legitimate software, including Apple iTunes, Notion, NVIDIA, and others.
The fake installers contained a sideloaded DLL file that decrypted and infected users with a DarkGate malware payload.

This campaign was part of the larger Water Hydra APT zero-day analysis. The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) monitored this campaign closely and observed its tactics. 
Using fake software installers, along with open redirects, is a potent combination and can lead to many infections. It is essential to remain 
vigilant and to instruct users not to trust any software installer that they receive outside of official channels. Businesses and individuals alike must take proactive 
steps to protect their systems from such threats.

 DarkGate, which operates on a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model is one of the most prolific, sophisticated, and active strains of malware in the cybercrime world. 
This piece of malicious software has often been used by financially motivated threat actors to target organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
